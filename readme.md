# Welcome to the Anythink Market repo

To start download the app Docker. Set it up and follow the guide if you've never used it before. then using a terminal of your choice (i used GIT BASH) open the root folder for the repo you cloned and verify docker is ready by running the following commands in your terminal: docker -v and docker-compose -v.
Then, run docker-compose up from the project root directory to load Anythink's backend and frontend. It will start both frontend and backend, including all the relevant dependencies, and the db. 
From there check the backend and front end are running correctly.

Please find more info about each part in the relevant Readme file ([frontend](frontend/readme.md) and [backend](backend/README.md)).

## Development

When implementing a new feature or fixing a bug, please create a new pull request against `main` from a feature/bug branch and add `@vanessa-cooper` as reviewer.

## First setup

**[TODO 05/01/2018 @vanessa-cooper]:** _It's been a while since anyone ran a fresh copy of this repo. I think it's worth documenting the steps needed to install and run the repo on a new machine?_
